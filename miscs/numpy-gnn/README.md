# Numpy-GNN

Numpy-GNN is a naive framework for constructing, training, and testing GNN models.

No tensorflow, no pytorch, it is implemented with pure numpy.

Currently Support:
* Activation functions: Relu, Sigmoid, Tanh
* Full connection layer (linear layer)
* Aggregation layer for graphs

We need:
* More aggregation layers to support graphSAGE
* RNN cells (basicRNN, LSTM, GRU) for GGNN
